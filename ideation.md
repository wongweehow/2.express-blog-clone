# Rough Ideas:

## responsive view design:

|    view               | width range     | what to include                               |
| ----------            | -----------     | ---------------                               |
| Desktop               | 1080px ++       | side nav + blog                               |
| Tablet / half desktop | 770px - 1080px  | same but less space between side nav and blog |
| Mobile                | 450px - 770px   | side nav become top nave, show only blog      |
